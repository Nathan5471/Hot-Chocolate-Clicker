# Hot Chocolate Clicker

## Description

This is a real time multiplayer clicker game. It is like every other clicker game, but multiple people can be playing in the same game. So everyone can click and contribute to the same total. Players can also make purchases that benefit everyone and take from the shared pool. It also features a real time player count so you can see how many people are currently in your game.

## Technologies

For the frontend I kept it simple and only used React and TypeScript. Instead of using CSS, I used TailwindCSS. The backend is built with Node, Express, and TypeScript. For real time communication I used Socket.io and the database is done with Prisma and Postgres.

## Deployment

This is deployed with Docker. If you want to host it yourself, use the docker-compose.yaml file, make sure to fill in the environment variables.
